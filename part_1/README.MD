<!-- Lessons Learned

This was the first time I ever had to create a website and use Django. I am so happy I did, Django was Instead, and I have thoroughly enjoyed this class. Another reason is because I want to create more websites in the future. The main concepts I had to advance my knowledge in during this project was when to use ORM and Prepared statements, as well as how to create an authentication system. I created a very basic authentication system and on the online server it does not work as a login but more as a way for a user to save data under a name, but understanding how to create one and where to save the data was complex and will help me in my future creations. When going through Django, I learned a lot more about ORM than I thought I would ( as it is the Default for Django). I also learned how to work with an HTML file/page, It was new to me, and to be able to change the style of things took a lot of time to figure out, but it was cool once I got it. Finally, if I were to start over again, I would have created a financial web page. The main reason is after this school year, I am going to build one, but it would have been nice to start a draft now. Another thing I would have done differently is how to learn to code in HTML and Django; I mostly threw myself into it and, because of that, wasted a lot of time. Instead I could have watched more tutorials and been able to do it better and quicker. Overall, I am very proud of my project and am going to put it on my resume, but I hope I will be able to look at it in a couple of years and think of it being very basic to what my talents can do then.
